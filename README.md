- Update `CMakeLists.txt` for portable compilation.

#### July 21, 2024

- **Initial Release**: Version 1.0.0 of ChemPlasKin is now available.

## Overview

ChemPlasKin integrates an electron Boltzmann equation solver, [CppBOLOS](https://github.com/ShaoX96/CppBOLOS), with the open-source combustion library [Cantera](https://cantera.org) at the source code level.
ChemPlasKin enables the calculation of species concentration and gas temperature over time within a unified gas-plasma framework.
This approach enables accurate modeling of both chemical thermal effects and plasma-induced heating, including fast gas heating and slower vibrational-translational relaxation processes.

## Key Features

- **Unified ODE system**: neutral gas and plasma kinetics are solved together in a single ODE system
- **Versatility**: Suitable for plasma assisted combustion (PAC) and plasma assisted fuel reforming.
- **Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with Bolsig+ cross-section input format and ZDPlasKin input mechanism.
- **High Performance**: Written in pure C++, at least 3x faster than ZDPlasKin + Cantera/CHEMKIN method.
- **Heat Loss model**: Designed for nanosecond pulsed discharges in pin-pin electrode configurations.

### Code architecture

## Getting Started

This section provides details on how to modify the Cantera source code and compile it for the usage of ChemPlasKin. 

If you encountered errors which you don't know how to solve, try pressing the `,` key on this webpage. Github will guide you to create a codespace. When a codespace is created, you will see a terminal. Execute `bash ./codespace.sh` in the terminal and everything will be setup and compiled.

1. **Prepare working directories**: (eg.`~/Destop/`)
   
   ```sh
   cd ~/Desktop
   mkdir ChemPlasProject
   cd ChemPlasKinProject
   ```

2. **Clone the Repositories**
   
   ```sh
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/Cantera/cantera.git
   git clone https://github.com/ShaoX96/ChemPlasKin.git
   ```
   
   Now under `ChemPlasKinProject/` you should have `cantera/` and `ChemPlasKin/`.

3. **Test [Compiling Cantera from Source](https://cantera.org/install/compiling-install.html#sec-compiling)**:  
   You should be familiar with [Compiling Cantera from Source](https://cantera.org/install/compiling-install.html#sec-compiling).
   A Conda environment is recommended for [Compilation Requirements](https://cantera.org/compiling/compilation-reqs.html#sec-conda).
   You should be able to compile the original Cantera source before making any modifications to it:
   
   ```sh
   cd cantera
   git checkout 3.0
   scons build
   ```

4. **Obtain external libraries for ChemPlasKin**:
- Create a new branch for Cantera and check (recommended)
  
  ```sh
  git checkout -b for_chemplaskin
  git branch
  ```

- Fetch the source code of [CppBOLOS](https://github.com/ShaoX96/CppBOLOS) and [muParser](https://beltoforion.de/en/muparser/) and put them under `cantera/ext/bolos/` and `cantera/ext/muparser/`, respectively.
  
  ```sh
  cd cantera/ext
  git clone https://github.com/ShaoX96/CppBOLOS.git
  mv CppBOLOS bolos
  git clone https://github.com/beltoforion/muparser.git
  ```

5. **Update `ext/SConscript`**: 
   
   ```sh
   cd cantera
   cp ../ChemPlasKin/ext/SConscript ext/SConscript
   ```

6. **Extend Cantera kinetics module**
   
   ```sh
   cp ../ChemPlasKin/include/kinetics/*.h include/cantera/kinetics/
   cp ../ChemPlasKin/include/base/Solution.h include/cantera/base/
   cp ../ChemPlasKin/src/kinetics/*.cpp src/kinetics/
   cp ../ChemPlasKin/src/base/Solution.cpp src/base/
   ```

7. **Stage and Commit Changes (Recommended)**
   
   Make sure you have set your email and name in your Git configuration.
   
   ```sh
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```
   
   Then commit your changes, for example: 
   
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Modify Cantera source for ChemPlasKin usage."
   ```

8. **Compile new library**
   
   ```sh
   cd cantera/
   scons build
   ```
   
   The compiled Cantera library is under `cantera/build/lib`. It is linked to ChemPlasKin through `ChemPlasKin/CMakeLists.txt`. 
   For example on macOS (no action needed):
   
   ```sh
   link_directories("../cantera/build/lib")
   target_link_libraries(ChemPlasKin PRIVATE cantera_shared ${ACCELERATE_FRAMEWORK} Threads::Threads)
   ```

9. **Build ChemPlasKin**
   
   ```sh
   cd ChemPlasKin
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

10. **Run an example**:
    Use `-case` to specify the running case path where `controlDict` and `chemPlasProperties` files are located. Use optional `-log` flag to control log level: `NONE`, `WARNING`, `INFO`(default) , or `DEBUG`. 
    
    ```sh
    ./ChemPlasKin -case ../examples/H2O2He -log DEBUG
    ```

11. **Check results**:
    
    ```sh
    cd ../examples/H2O2He
    python plot.py
    ```

## Data input

Two input data files, cross section and reaction mechanism, are needed, as specified in `chemPlasProperties`:

```sh
csDataFile       "<case>/../../data/LXCat/bolsigdb_H2O2HE.dat";
mechFile         "<case>/../../data/PAC_kinetics/ZDPlasKin_kinetics/Mao-H2O2He/H2O2HE_Mao.yaml";
```

The `data/` directory contains:

- `LXCat/`: cross section data in [LXCat](https://nl.lxcat.net/home/) format for CppBOLOS
- `PAC_kinetics/`: unified gas-plasma mechanism files in YAML format

An optional parser tool, `parsePlasKin.py`, is available to convert ZDPlasKin input mechanism files 
into the human-readable YAML format automatically.

```sh
cd data/PAC_kinetics/ZDPlasKin_kinetics/kineticsParser
python parsePlasKin.py --input "plasmaH2O2.inp" --output "parsedPlasKin.yaml"
```
